# Facade Pattern

## Reference
[Refactoring Guru: Singleton](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/flyweight)

## Intent
The intent of the Facade Pattern is to provide a unified and simplified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. This pattern helps in reducing the complexity of the subsystem by providing a single entry point for the client.

## Problem It Solves
The Facade Pattern solves the problem of dealing with complex subsystems by providing a simplified interface. This is particularly useful when you have a system with multiple interdependent classes, and you want to provide a simple way for clients to interact with the system without exposing its internal complexity.
