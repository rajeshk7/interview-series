# Composite Pattern

## Reference
[Refactoring Guru: Singleton](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/composite)

## Intent
The intent of the Composite Pattern is to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. This pattern allows clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

## Problem It Solves
The Composite Pattern solves the problem of treating individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. This is particularly useful when you need to work with tree structures, such as representing a file system, organization hierarchies, or graphical objects. By using the Composite Pattern, you can simplify client code that deals with complex tree structures.
