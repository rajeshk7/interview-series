# Prototype Design Pattern

## Reference
[Refactoring Guru: Prototype](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/prototype)

## Intent
The Prototype is a creational design pattern that allows you to copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.

## Problem it Solves
The Prototype pattern addresses the issue of creating new objects by copying existing ones, which is useful when:
- The cost of creating a new object is more expensive than copying an existing one.
- The system should be independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented.
