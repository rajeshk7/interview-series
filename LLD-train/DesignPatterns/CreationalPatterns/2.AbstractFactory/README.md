# Abstract Factory Design Pattern

## Reference
[Refactoring Guru: Abstract Factory](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/abstract-factory)

## Intent
The Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that allows you to produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## Problem it Solves
The Abstract Factory pattern addresses the issue of creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their exact classes. This is useful when:
- A system needs to be independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented.
- A system should be configured with one of multiple families of products.
