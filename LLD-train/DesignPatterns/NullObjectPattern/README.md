# Null Object Pattern

## Overview

The Null Object Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that uses polymorphism to provide a default behavior for a null object. Instead of using `null` references to indicate the absence of an object, the Null Object Pattern provides a special object that implements the expected interface but does nothing.

## Intent

The intent of the Null Object Pattern is to provide an object as a surrogate for the absence of an object. This pattern helps in avoiding `null` references and provides a default behavior for the "null" case, making the code more robust and easier to maintain.

## Problem It Solves

The Null Object Pattern solves the problem of dealing with `null` references by providing a default object that does nothing. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to avoid `null` checks and provide a default behavior for the absence of an object. By using the Null Object Pattern, you can simplify your code and make it more readable and maintainable.
