# Iterator Pattern

Refer: [Iterator Design Pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/iterator)

## Intent
The intent of the Iterator Pattern is to provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. This pattern allows you to traverse a collection without needing to understand its internal structure.

## Problem It Solves
The Iterator Pattern solves the problem of traversing a collection without exposing its internal structure. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to iterate over different types of collections in a uniform way, such as in lists, trees, or graphs. By using the Iterator Pattern, you can make your code more flexible, maintainable, and easier to extend.
