# State Pattern

Refer: [Factory Method Design Pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/state)

## Intent
The intent of the State Pattern is to allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. This pattern encapsulates state-specific behavior and transitions, making the code more maintainable and scalable.

## Problem It Solves
The State Pattern solves the problem of having complex conditional logic for state transitions by encapsulating state-specific behavior into separate classes. This makes the code easier to understand, maintain, and extend. It is particularly useful in scenarios where an object can be in multiple states and the behavior of the object changes based on its state.
