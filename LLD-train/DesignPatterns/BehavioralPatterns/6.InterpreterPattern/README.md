# Interpreter Pattern

Refer: [Interpreter Design Pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/interpreter)

## Intent
The intent of the Interpreter Pattern is to define a representation for a language's grammar along with an interpreter that uses this representation to interpret sentences in the language. This pattern is particularly useful for designing and implementing domain-specific languages.

## Problem It Solves
The Interpreter Pattern solves the problem of interpreting sentences in a language by defining a grammar and providing an interpreter for the language. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to parse and evaluate expressions, such as in mathematical expressions, configuration files, or scripting languages. By using the Interpreter Pattern, you can make your code more flexible, maintainable, and easier to extend.
