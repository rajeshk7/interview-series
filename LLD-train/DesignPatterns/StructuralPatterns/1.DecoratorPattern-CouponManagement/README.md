## Decoratore Pattern

## Reference
[Refactoring Guru: Singleton](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/decorator)

## Intent
The intent of the Decorator Pattern is to dynamically add additional responsibilities to an object without altering its structure. This pattern provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

## Problem it Solves
The Decorator Pattern solves the problem of extending the functionality of objects in a way that is both flexible and reusable. Instead of creating numerous subclasses to cover every possible combination of behaviors, decorators allow you to compose behaviors at runtime. This approach adheres to the Open/Closed Principle, enabling classes to be open for extension but closed for modification.
