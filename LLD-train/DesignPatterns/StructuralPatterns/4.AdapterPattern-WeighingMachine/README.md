# Adapter Pattern

## Reference
[Refactoring Guru: Singleton](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/adapter)

## Intent
The intent of the Adapter Pattern is to allow objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate. This pattern is particularly useful when integrating with legacy code or third-party libraries that have different interfaces.

## Problem It Solves
The Adapter Pattern solves the problem of incompatible interfaces by providing a way to use an existing class with a different interface. This is useful when you want to reuse existing code without modifying it, especially when dealing with third-party libraries or legacy systems.
